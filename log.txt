* 11/15 
   * [9 AM - 10 AM]
      * Everyone
         * Searched for a dataset to use
         * Established forms of communication and set up Github
         * Did some preprocessing of the data
   * [4 PM - 6 PM]
      * Anson
         * Created the LoanApplicant case class 
         * Finished the processData function that parses the csv
      * Ishaan
         * Debugged errors for spark for the LoanApplicant data parsing on server
* 11/16
   * [3 PM - 4 PM]
      * Michael
         * Created the Jupyter Notebook to do basic preprocessing
* 11/22
   * [10 AM - 12 PM]
      * Anson
         * Edited the Jupyter Notebook to handle all features
         * Attempt to parse the csv so all features can be included in the Loan Applicant class
* 11/23
   * [10 AM - 12 PM]
      * Anson
         * Edit LoanApplicant to include a maximum of 22 features due to errors for Arrays over that size
         * Did feature selection to choose which ones to keep
* 11/29
   * [9 AM - 10 AM]
      * Everyone
         * Decide what machine learning algorithm to implement
         * Ishaan - Logistic Regression
         * Michael - KNN
         * Anson - SVC
* 11/30
   * [6 PM - 9 PM]
      * Anson
         * Wrote code for the SVC
         * Created metric functions
      * Ishaan
         * Trained Logistic Regression Model on data and amended out class imbalances in data
      * Michael
         * Wrote KNN Classifier
* 11/31
   * [7 PM-10 PM]
      * Anson
         * Changed algorithms to Naive Bayes since SVC was performing poorly 
         * Wrote code for Naive Bayes
      * Ishaan
         * Tuned hyperparameters and implemented regularization to handle features calling as well as class imbalance
      * Michael
         * Tuned KNN classifier to current values of K, selected feature sets, and threshold value.
